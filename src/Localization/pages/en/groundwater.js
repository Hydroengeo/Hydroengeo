    "Methodological requirements have been developed for regional hydrogeological studies (1:200000) in areas with changed natural and technogenic conditions, the compilation of a new generation state hydrogeological map and the creation of a hydrogeochemical database of changes in groundwater quality based on GIS technologies. ",
  intro2: `An automated bank of hydrogeochemical data and data entry based on the results of the state hydrogeological survey at scale 1:200000 have been developed.
          An automated information-analytical system on a PC has been created with the structure of formal-logical combinations of requests and the issuance of information on request. A system has been developed for searching and displaying the location of objects on a map by attributive and spatial queries and an inverse problem - attributive characteristics of objects by their location on a map using the GIS technology, ArcGIS program. 
          Linking a bank of hydrochemical data to cartographic materials, improving access to information for predicting changes in water quality, combinations of queries and issuing information on interpretable boundaries for specific classes of water mineralization. Providing information in a user-friendly form and bringing it to the consumer.

    "Digital map of hydrogeological content based on the results of complex hydrogeological and engineering-geological surveys at a scale of 1:200000 and 1:50000.",
  intro4: `An automated information and reference database using GIS technologies has been developed, which makes it possible to accelerate the search for the necessary material many times over at the bibliographic, territorial and thematic levels. Prompt and full review the hydrogeological, engineering-geological and geoecological knowledge of the territory. Its binding to the map gives the hydrogeologist a better idea of the subject under study.. 
          The created database allows to integrate it with other databases, thereby expanding the possibilities of systematizing geological information on various aspects of hydrogeology, engineering geology and geoecology, containing information on the chemical composition of groundwater, hydrogeological and engineering-geological parameters of aquifers and rocks of the aeration zone, lithological composition and stratigraphic age of the section, geophysical properties, etc.

In the future, it will be possible to obtain existing information on observation specialized points: 
          -about the location and characteristics of the observation wells of the HGD field; (coordinates, absolute mark, filter installation interval, depth, chemical composition, formulas, graphs).
          - about average monthly, average annual values of the level in observation wells for a specific year for the HGD field;
          - a series of long-term observations of the groundwater level in a particular observation well for all years, the data for which are maintained by observations.

  intro16: `The regularity of changes in the level of groundwater at each observation point has been established, depending on the conditions for the location of wells in relation to faults, on the strength of the upcoming earthquake and its epicentral distance. The hydrogeochemical composition of groundwater was studied and analyzed at 6 observation points. Regularities of changes in hydrogeodynamic and hydrogeochemical parameters under the influence of tectonic movements of the Karzhantau fault are revealed.. Based on the results of the study of the groundwater hydrogeodynamic regime and hydrogeochemical parameters at the observed points, an assessment will be made and the most effective parameters will be identified, 
          which can be traced during the preparation of strong earthquakes, which can be indicators or precursors of earthquakes. 
          A number of works were carried out to introduce the Geochemist Workbench program into the work.

  intro17: `As a result of the work carried out on the reinterpretation of geophysical data, it was established that within the zones of deep faults, natural hydrogeological systems are formed, which significantly change in their properties both in depth and strike due to the discreteness of the geological environment. `,
  intro18: `It has been established that discontinuous structures are not only a discontinuity of the earth's crust, but an autonomous and independent geological structure with its own structural and formational features, which is a catalyst for geological processes. Thus, new methods and calculations have shown that the zone of influence of faults is not always tied to its length and depth, but most likely depends on the geological and structural conditions. `,
